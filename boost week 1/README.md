# Skilstak Boost week 1

## Zettelkasten

Zettelkasten is a memory map or some sort of file distribution created Niklas Luhmann where he used to have loads of cabinets filled with reference papers, they most contain
a header, a body and a reference. ("WARNING") don't use index cards, they suck. I made a physical and digital zettelkasten using pen and paper and Github repo. I usually
write important and not-so important things just for the sake of referencing. The limitation of characters by zettelkasten makes your notaking more useful and simpler. 


pros:

* easier to locate knowledge
* it's free
* you can use both physical and digital
* title less than 50 unicodes
* body of about 20-30 lines

## Markdown

Markdown is a  lightweight markup language created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. It's an easy way of writing documents, no unecessary coding syntax like in html5 and
less populated screen. It's good for writing the zettelkasten, it's the method I use. There's ton of variations of markdown, but basic and pandoc are both the superior the ones.

pros:

* It's free
* Not overcomplicated(good for beginners)
* simple syntax



## Github

We'll be using github, it's the most important tool for a developer, because it's the showcase of your work, any code, repo or project will be there, that's where
people will look up to see if you're what you claim you're.

pros: 

* Built in VSCode editor
* Built in search
* Universal with many connections
* Displays Markdown

## Virtualbox

It's the most easiest way of having a linux machine installed, don't dual boot, it's not necessary ando overcomplicated.

* free
* virtual linux machine on my home computer
* no dualboot
* can mess with it

## Ubuntu Server 

We installed ubuntu server, which is more lightweight than the desktop version(bloated).

* Download from Canonical web site
* Make sure "server" since smaller
* Server version emulates a cloud on our machine
* Find "New" from menus or icons
* Pick Linux from OS pull-down
* Pick Ubuntu 64-bit from pull-down
* Set about 2048 MB RAM
* Set about 20GB disk

## Install it and play with it

use commands like:

'ls'
'pwd'
'ls -la'
ls -l'
'sudo'
