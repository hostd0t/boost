## Unix History

Unix was created in 1969 by AT&T at Bell Labs. the brilliant minds behind this gigantic project were Kent Thompson, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. Unix was previously
written in **Assembly**, but it was deemed too difficult of a language to be kept in use. Mr. Khernigan and Thompson created the C language just for the sake of coding a new
unix operating system. After a few years, Unix became so popular it had licensed itself to other companies, so we got solaris from sun microsystems, BSD from University of
Berkeley and other related unix-like operating systems.

## What's a shell ?

The shell is the first contact you have with your computer. It's called  shell because it's the outermost layer around an operating system. Any user must be comfortable
with the syntax of the shell and be able to use a shell specific scripting language(bash,csh,ksh). A shell it's both present in the gui( graphical user interface) and
CLI( Command line interface).

## What's the difference between terminal, CLI and shell

A terminal is a text input and output environment. It is a program that acts as a wrapper and allows us to enter commands that the computer processes.
In plain English again, it's the "window" in which you enter the actual commands your computer will process. The history of the terminal goes way back to the 1940 and 1950, where
computations were made using punching cards, where each hole represents a value and it's applied to the computer. It was extremely difficult to write code( especially because
 it was hand-made code), so it was invented a machine which would peform the job of the punching card, but it was necessary to flip a switch for each letter ( A was seven times), so it was 
 a tedious process, so they came up with a good idea, why not plug in a typewriter to the machine and let the typewriter translate the coding and let implement the code as well, so that's where
 tty came to be(teletype).
 
 A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer. Command-line interfaces are also called command-line user interfaces, console user interfaces and character user interfaces.
 
 The outer layer of an operating system, otherwise known as the user interface. The term originally referred to the software that processed the commands typed into the Unix operating system. For example, the Bourne shell was the original Unix command line processor, and C shell and Korn shell were developed later.
